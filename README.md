# Design Philosophy

Back in college, I spent a lot of time in web development and was drawn to pixel-perfect frontends. I loved when every element had a bit of life — borders that reacted, icons that moved, pages that felt dynamic. Most of my earlier portfolio versions were filled with that energy. They reflected the kind of work I was focused on back then, and the kind of portfolios I looked up to.

After moving into data and finishing college, that changed. My approach to design became calmer, more deliberate. I started to prefer things that were clean, typographic, and minimal — where the impact comes from clarity rather than decoration.

This version of my portfolio follows that idea. It’s intentionally simple: almost no icons, no flashy animations, just careful spacing, color, and type. The small interactions that remain — a hovering link, a shifting arrow, the theme toggle — are there to give small hints of motion without clutter.

The goal was to make something that feels quiet but intentional. Minimal, but not empty.
