          <p>In data engineering, we essentially do plumbing, so you will usually find me laying down pipelines and 
            tigheting the nutbolts. Although, a leak happens more than I show or admit.

          <p>As of now, I am an Associate Analyst @ Deloitte USI, which is a fancy way of defining junior staff in <i>ConsultingSpeak</i></p>
