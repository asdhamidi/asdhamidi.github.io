        <p>
            I never quite mastered the art of talking about myself, but here’s the condensed version
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a Data Engineer at Deloitte USI where I wrangle data puzzles and wrestle pipelines into submission. My journey into tech was unexpected - an Arts kid who took a wrong turn and found a home in code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I studied Computer Science at GEU, Dehradun where I mostly dabbled in the <i>WebDev</i> side of things
            (thank you, <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>) before landing in the world of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            When not at work, you will find me: Debating the superiority of Linux, looking at the sky to spot a plane and say, "Do you know where that plane is going?", or reading the most random article on Wikipedia
        </p>
        <p>
            I like building things—code, bad puns, or overly elaborate playlists. Currently on a quest to prove that Lemon tea is better than Chai (controversial, I know).
