      <p>
        Talking about myself is still as tough as it was in the campus placement
        interviews, but here is an attempt.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was inclined to take up Arts while growing up, but thanks to some lucky turn of events in high
        school, I ended up in tech. It turned out to be a pretty good decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        In college, I mostly dabbled in the <i>WebDev</i> side of things
        (thank you, <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>), with the occasional tinkering with data
        analysis. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from GEU, Dehradun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently at Deloitte USI in Hyderabad, where I work in the data engineering team. You will usually find me staring
        at rows of data to make sense of or working on ETL pipelines. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When not in front of my work laptop, I usually write, read, watch
        pretentious cinephilic movies, or tell jokes to my friends, which for
        some reason, they don't laugh at.
